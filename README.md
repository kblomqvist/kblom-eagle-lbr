# My Eagle library

I have done my best to keep this library in a good shape and order.
Every component has a tag to speed up searching, and a link to the datasheet
in component's description field. Supply symbols are prefixed by underscore
(_) to separate them from other components. Double underscore (__) is reserved
for extra helper schematics etc. I have also included Farnell id to the
component's attribute list if there only is one to add.
